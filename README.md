# qpid-messaging

Examples in qpid.messaging folder are using the Qpid Messaging C++ API. It supports both AMQP 1.0 and 0-10. To run the examples:
- Install Qpid Proton C library (only needed for AMQP 1.0 support)
- Install Qpid Messaging C++ API
- Change the hostname / IP address, port number, paths to the certificates and queue names
- Run the examples

## BroadcastReceiver.cpp

This example connects to the AMQP broker using AMQP version 0-10 or 1.0, opens a consumer to the broadcast queue and starts consuming the broadcasts.

## RequestResponse.cpp

This example connects to the AMQP broker using AMQP version 0-10 or 1.0, sends a request message and wait for a response, which should be sent by the Eurex system.

## SSL configuration (Linux)

The SSL certificates have to be configured using the certutil utility and envionement variables

- Create certificate dabatase in certs directory
    certutil -N -d sql:<path to cert dir>

- Import public node certificate
    certutil -A -n <hostname> -i <hostname>.crt -d sql:<path to cert dir> -t P,,

- Import member certificate
    pk12util -i ABCFR_ABCFRALMMACC1.p12 -d sql:<path to cert dir> -W 123456

- Export environmental variables before execution

    - Path to certificate DB (cert9.db, key4.db, pkcs11.txt)
        export QPID_SSL_CERT_DB=sql:<path to cert dir>
    - Path to file containing password
        export QPID_SSL_CERT_PASSWORD_FILE=<path to cert dir>/amq_cert_db.pwd
    - Member alias
        export QPID_SSL_CERT_NAME=abcfr_abcfralmmacc1
